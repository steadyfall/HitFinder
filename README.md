# HitFinder
An application that lets the user search for any artist and returns as many numbers of top songs as that particular artist they had searched for.

<br>
## → ABOUT
The aim of this project is to design an application that would allow the user to search for any artist, which would then ask the user for the number of top songs that they want, after which it would show the given number of top songs.        
<br>
## → LANGUAGES
- Python
- Spotify API
<br>
<br>

### \* **NOTE** \*
The program is still being made and I am keen on adding new features to this, to make it more versatile and unique.
\
\
Plans for the FUTURE : 
- Work on the "About" button to return the details of the given artist using Wikipedia API
- Create a Song Search option that would return the YouTube link of the searched song

You are free to suggest new ideas to add to this project. ❤
